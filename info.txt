General
• Create a basic navigation that allows you to switch between 2 pages: monitor and alerts.
• Use this API (with this endpoint: wss://streamer.cryptocompare.com/v2) to subscribe
for this topic: 8~Binance~BTC~USDT . Register for a free API key, you’ll need
r_price_poll_basic and r_price_stream_basic rights for the key. Mind, that on the
website the stream will might throw an error, but in code it should work.
• The navigation should have a start/stop button that controls the stream.
• Use the UI library of your choice (and use all the libraries you like).

• We know the result will be a relatively small codebase, but make sure to use best
practises and structure your code.
“Monitor” page
• This is a page where a user can see some orders happening on Binance live.
• A “terminal-like” monospaced fullscreen stream of orders, 1 row 1 order.
• Top row is the latest. Displays max of 500 lines.
• Display all the available data in a human readable way - go nuts on formatting, colouring
or whatever you feel like.
• Alerting orders should be highlighted (discussed on next page).
“Alerts” page
• Purpose of this page is to be in a trading center’s wall monitor so traders can see if any
alerts happened recently.
• The app should record alerts by 3 different rules:

• “Cheap order” is triggered when an order is at a price below $50000
• “Solid order” is triggered when more than 10BTC is in the order
• “Big biznis here” is triggered, when an order’s total value is over $1m
• Each rule should have a counter - counting the number of each orders alerting for the
rule.
• Each rule should have a list with all the alerts with 4 columns: (alertMessage, price,
quantity, total)
• Only count/display alerts triggered in the past 1 minute (all of them, not just the ones
that alerting in the trimmed 500).
